Create virtual environment:
    in terminal, enter "python -m venv env"
    Should make new folder, give it time till new terminal line appears
    run ".\env\Scripts\activate", then do pip install -r requirements.txt
    ctr+shift+p to open vs code search and type python: select interpreter
    The env in this folder should appear. Choose that one

Extensions:
    Python
    Pylance
    Python Debugger
    Live sass compiler
    "Sass (.sass only)" should see this from just typing sass at the top
    SQLite Viewer

Everytime you want to work on project:
    (In cmd, not powershell)
    Start environment:
        .\env\Scripts\activate
    Leave environment (ALSO do this when done working on project):
        deactivate

Python files in the outer most directory
    app.py has routes
    extension.py essentially initializes app and db for other files to use to help reduce
        amount of code on each file
    fillDB.py has methods for filling db with dummy data using python. I believe this should
        be updated using a method that uses sql, but I currently do not know how. It currently works
    models.py has the db models 
HTML (routes) in templates
CSS and JS in static
    styles.scss handles the css. It is easier to work with, and creates corresponding css files
    Can create other scss files if styles gets too large. Just make sure to configure html accordingly
